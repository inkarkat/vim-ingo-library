"*******************************************************************************
"* PURPOSE:
"   Create (or re-use an existing) scratch buffer (i.e. doesn't correspond to a
"   file on disk, but can be saved as such).
"   To keep the scratch buffer (and create a new scratch buffer on the next
"   invocation), rename the current scratch buffer via ':file <newname>', or
"   make it a normal buffer via ':setl buftype='.
"
"* ASSUMPTIONS / PRECONDITIONS:
"   None.
"* EFFECTS / POSTCONDITIONS:
"   Creates or opens scratch buffer and loads it in a window (as specified by
"   a:windowOpenCommand) and activates that window.
"* INPUTS:
"   a:scratchDirspec	Local working directory for the scratch buffer
"			(important for :! scratch commands). Pass empty string
"			to maintain the current CWD as-is. Pass '.' to maintain
"			the CWD but also fix it via :lcd.
"			(Attention: ':set autochdir' will reset any CWD once the
"			current window is left!) Pass the getcwd() output if
"			maintaining the current CWD is important for
"			a:scratchCommand.
"   a:scratchFilename	The name for the scratch buffer, so it can be saved via
"			either :w! or :w <newname>. If this already exists (but
"			isn't a scratch buffer), a different one will be
"			generated.
"   a:scratchIsFile	Flag whether the scratch buffer should behave like a
"			file (i.e. adapt to changes in the global CWD), or not.
"			If false and a:scratchDirspec is empty, there will be
"			only one scratch buffer with the same a:scratchFilename,
"			regardless of the scratch buffer's directory path.
"   a:scratchCommand	Ex command(s) to populate the scratch buffer, e.g.
"			":1read myfile". Use :1read so that the first empty line
"			will be kept (it is deleted automatically), and there
"			will be no trailing empty line.
"			Pass empty string if you want to populate the scratch
"			buffer yourself.
"			Pass a Funcref to build the scratch contents with it.
"			Pass a List of lines to set the scratch buffer contents
"			directly to the lines.
"   a:windowOpenCommand	Ex command to open the window, e.g. "vnew" or
"			"topleft new". Also supports "pedit".
"   a:NextFilenameFuncref   Optional funcref that is invoked (with a:filename)
"                           to generate file names for the generated buffer
"                           should the desired one (a:filename) already exist
"                           but not be a generated buffer.
"* RETURN VALUES:
"   Indicator whether the scratch buffer has been opened:
"   0	Failed to open scratch buffer.
"   1	Already in scratch buffer window.
"   2	Jumped to open scratch buffer window.
"   3	Loaded existing scratch buffer in new window.
"   4	Created scratch buffer in new window.
"   Note: To handle errors caused by a:scratchCommand, you need to put this
"   method call into a try..catch block and :close the scratch buffer when an
"   exception is thrown.

"*******************************************************************************
"* PURPOSE:
"   Create (or re-use an existing) scratch buffer that invokes a custom a:Writer
"   when it is written.
"
"* ASSUMPTIONS / PRECONDITIONS:
"   None.
"* EFFECTS / POSTCONDITIONS:

"   a:Writer            Ex command or Funcref that is invoked on :write.
"			If empty, writing will not be supported, and this will
"			work like ingo#buffer#scratch#Create().
"   a:scratchCommand	Ex command(s) to populate the scratch buffer, e.g.
"			":1read myfile". Use :1read so that the first empty line
"			will be kept (it is deleted automatically), and there
