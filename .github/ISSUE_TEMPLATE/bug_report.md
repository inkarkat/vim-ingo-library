**Frequent Issues**

* **Sudden problems after updating**: Did you check out the default _master_ branch? Unless you want to participate in feature development and alpha testing, I would recommend that you switch from _master_ to the _stable_ branch; this way, you'll only update to released versions that are (hopefully) better tested and documented.
* **Neovim**: I don't explicitly consider nor test Neovim compatibility; my plugins are written for Vim. If a plugin can be made to work on Neovim with trivial changes, I wouldn't mind including them, but anything more involved should in my opinion be filed as a compatibility bug against Neovim (as its homepage proclaims: _Fully compatible with Vim's editing model and the Vimscript language._)
